Below is just a list of some available parameters. To learn more on the usage of such parameters, please refer to [CP4WAIOps Advanced Install Options Using GitOps](./cp4waiops-advanced-install-options.md).\n\n| Parameter                             |

cp4waiops.eventManager.version        | string | 1.6.4         | The version of Event Manager.\n| cp4waiops.eventManager.deploymentType | string | trial         | The deployment type of Event Manager, valid values include: trial, production.\n| globalImagePullSecrets                | array  | n/a           | A list of registries for image pull when needed during the install.\n\nFor example, if the custom build to be installed includes images from registries other than the official IBM entitled registry, you can use `globalImagePullSecrets` to specify all necessary information for these registries including registry URLs, as well as username and password to access these registries.\n\nAgain, since these parameters are invisible, you can add them when filling in the form in `HELM` &gt; `VALUES` field:\n\n```yaml\nglobalImagePullSecrets:\n- registry: &lt;my_own_registry_1&gt;\nusername: &lt;username_to_registry_1&gt;\npassword: &lt;password_to_registry_1&gt;\n- registry:

You must use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, <code>apps.clustername.abc.xyz.com</code>. You can retrieve the FQDN by running the following command:</p> <pre><code>INGRESS_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=openshift-ingress-operator\nappDomain=`oc -n ${INGRESS_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE} get ingresscontrollers default -o json | python -c \"import json,sys;obj=json.load(sys.stdin);print obj['status']['domain'];\"`\necho ${appDomain}\n</code></pre> <p>Note: - If you use a repository that is forked from the official Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps GitOps repository or a different branch, then you must update the values of the <code>Repository URL</code> and <code>Revision</code> parameters to match your repository and branch. For example, if you use <code>https://github.com/&lt;myaccount&gt;/cp4waiops-gitops</code> and <code>dev</code> branch, then these two parameters must be changed.</p>"},{"location":"how-to-deploy-cp4waiops-36/#verify-the-cloud-pak-for-watson-aiops-installation","title":"Verify the Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps installation","text":"<p>When Ceph and Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps are ready, you can see these Apps with a status of <code>Healthy</code> and <code>Synced</code> in the Argo CD UI.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can check the topology of Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps from the Argo CD UI as follows:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can also check your Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps installation from the command line.
