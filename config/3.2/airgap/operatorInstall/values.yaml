# CP4WAIOps - Common Configs
###################################
spec:

  ## cp4waiops_namespace is the project (namespace) that you want to create the AI Manager instance in.
  ## You must create a custom project (namespace) and not use the default, kube-system,
  ## kube-public, openshift-node, openshift-infra, or openshift projects (namespaces). 
  ## This is because AI Manager uses Security Context Constraints (SCC), 
  ## and SCCs cannot be assigned to pods created in one of the default OpenShift projects (namespaces).

  cp4waiops_namespace: cp4waiops
